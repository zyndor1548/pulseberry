### PROBLEM STATEMENT
Modern FinTech platforms rely on multiple external providers for payments, BNPL, and compliance (KYC/AML). Each provider exposes different APIs, error semantics, rate limits, and failure behaviors. As platforms scale, this results in integration debt that makes systems brittle, hard to reason about, and unsafe under failure conditions.
### PROJECT OVERVIEW
This project implements a FinTech Integration Mesh: a production-inspired middleware layer that sits between client applications and multiple external payment, BNPL, and compliance providers.

Instead of integrating directly with provider-specific APIs, clients interact with a single unified interface. The mesh handles normalization, routing, fault tolerance, and compliance-grade observability, allowing the core application to remain stable even when providers are unreliable.
